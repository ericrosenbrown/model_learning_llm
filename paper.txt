Title: Effectively Learning Option Preconditions with Large Language Models
Abstract
Problem: We address the problem of learning preconditions of options.
Related work: Prior approaches generate a supervised dataset in an online manner by collecting positive and negative state examples via policy rollouts.
Challenge: Randomly sampling states is expensive and expotentially challenging, and even with active learning strategies, starting with no prior information about the distriubtion can require many samples, and hand-crating priors is not scalable.
Our solution: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce an initial distrubution over states (which may be wrong) to make online learning more effecient.

To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage LLMs to make learning option preconditions more effecient.

Background:
- An environment is a tuple (A,B,C,D) (Basing this off tom silver corl paper)
- an object type a in A has a name (button) and a tuple of real-valued features of dimnesion dim(a) (x,y,z,radius, color)
- an object o in O has a name (button1) and a type, denoted type(o) in A.
- a state x in X is an assignment of objects to feature vectors (copy size from tom)
- the action space B is action space.
- The transition function C is standard x,a->x' (stochastic potentially)
- a predicate p in D has a name (Touching) and a tuple of types (e.g: stick, button)
- A ground atom is a predicate and a mapping from its type to object (Touching(stick1,button3))
- A lifted atom instead has a mapping to a tped variables which are placegolders for objects (Touching (?s, ?b))
- Predicates induce a state abstraction: abstract(x) denotes the set of ground atoms that hold true in state x, with all others assumed false.
- we use s in S to denoate an abstract state (abstract: X -> S)
- Define option = (I, pi, tau)
- these are defined over X (low-level state).
- arguments are varaibles with types in A.
- We define a precondition as a set of lifted atoms over predicates D and ????
